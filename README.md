Music Store Project
Overview

This project is a music store where users can search for albums by genre, artist, or title. It includes an additional form to add orders when an album is not found in the catalog.
Registered users can leave a message through the “About Us” section using a form that requires first name, last name, email, and message.
Project Structure
Scripts are organized by genre (rock, tango, pop, etc.).
A base template (base.html) is used to maintain consistent design across pages.
